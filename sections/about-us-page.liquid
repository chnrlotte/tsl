    <h1>everyday feels like sunday</h1>
    <p>
      The feeling of Sunday is often associated with a sense of peace, relaxation, and contentment. It’s a day of rest,
      where people can slow down and take a break from the busy demands of daily life. Sunday is a day for spending time
      with loved ones, indulging in self-care activities, and engaging in leisurely pursuits. It’s a day that feels cozy
      and comforting, with a hint of anticipation for the week ahead.
